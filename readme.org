* Introduction
Refer to the original [[https://github.com/dempfi/ayu][Ayu-theme]]. It's truly an amazing set of theme and someone has to port it to Emacs eventually.

This repo currently only provides 2 versions of Ayu-theme: the light & the dark. Refer to the files with correspondent
names.

* Installing

Just copy the lisp files to your emacs config dir (ie: *~/.emacs.d*) and load them...

*Example*
#+begin_src  code
cp ayu-*.el ~/.emacs.d/themes
#+end_src

And somewhere, with a little lisp...
#+begin_src lisp
(setq custom-theme-directory "~/.emacs.d/themes")
#+end_src

* Why not Melpa?
I'd love to have this published to *Melpa* but I'm just too lazy to do that. If you find it nice and worth sharing, and if you can help publishing this, that would be awesome.

* License/Credit
All go to the original author of Ayu-theme.

I just did the copy works.

The colors might not be 100% accurate.
